==========

This layer provides support for the CyaSSL embedded SSL library.

CyaSSL is a lightweight SSL library written in C and targeted at
embedded and RTOS environments - primarily because of its small size,
speed, and feature set. With common build sizes between 30-100kB,
it is typically up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL. Other feature
highlights include support for TLS 1.2 and DTLS, full client and
server support, abstraction layers for easy porting, CRL and OCSP
support, key and cert generation, and much more. For a full feature
list, please visit the CyaSSL webpage at:
