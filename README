NOTE: For the most up to date Open Embedded / Yocto layer for wolfSSL,
please see the repository located here:

https://github.com/wolfSSL/meta-wolfssl

This layer provides support for the wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) embedded
SSL library.

wolfSSL is a lightweight SSL library written in C and targeted at
embedded and RTOS environments - primarily because of its small size,
speed, and feature set. With common build sizes between 30-100kB,
it is typically up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL. Other feature
highlights include support for TLS 1.2 and DTLS, full client and
server support, abstraction layers for easy porting, CRL and OCSP
support, key and cert generation, and much more. For a full feature
list, please visit the wolfSSL webpage at:
